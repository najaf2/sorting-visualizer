# Sorting Visualizer

View Live at: https://najaf2.github.io/sorting-visualizer/

A website to visualize various sorting algorithms.

Current sorting algos are: merge sort, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and bogosort. Heap sort and radix sort are also implemented but the visualizations are a bit off so they are not included in the UI options.
